# Google Workplace :: Reports API :: Singer Tap

This application retrieves Gmail data from a Google Workplace (formerly G-suite) organization. The privacy of user data and personal identifying information is a focus, thus all data for each request is cleaned and modeled at the point of origin before being transported into a data warehouse.

The aggregated data follows a simple JSON schema that contains the following properties:

- `timestamp`
  - The time the query was run
- `start_date`
  - The range start date of the query
- `end_date`
  - The range end date of the query
- `query_type`
  - The type of query
    - `daily active users`
    - `daily emails sent`
    - `daily emails received`
    - `weekly active users`
    - `weekly emails sent`
    - `weekly emails received`
- `total`
  - The integer total returned by the above query types

This application utilizes the [Reports API](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/reports/v1/get-start/getting-started) which is part of the [Admin SDK](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk).

## Setup

The Google API Python Client documentation provides a guide for completing all necessary steps to ensure the application and environment are configured correclty. The guide can be found here:

[Using OAuth 2.0 for Server to Server Applications](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-python-client/blob/master/docs/oauth-server.md)

The key steps in the guide are:

- Creating a service account
- Delegating domain-wide authority to the service account
